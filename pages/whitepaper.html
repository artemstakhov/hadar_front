            <div class="title">HADAR WHITEPAPER</div>
            <div class="first_text text _anim-items">The rise of blockchains as a new Internet infrastructure has led to developers
                deploying tens of thousands of decentralized applications at rapidly growing rates. Unfortunately,
                blockchain usage is not yet ubiquitous due to frequent outages, high costs, low throughput limits, and
                numerous security concerns. To enable mass adoption in the web3 era, blockchain infrastructure needs to
                follow the path of cloud infrastructure as a trusted, scalable, cost-efficient, and continually
                improving platform for building widely-used applications.<br><br>

                We present the Hadar blockchain, designed with scalability, safety, reliability, and upgradeability as
                key principles, to address these challenges. The Hadar blockchain has been developed over the past three
                years by over 350+ developers across the globe. It offers new and novel innovations in consensus, smart
                contract design, system security, performance, and decentralization. The combination of these
                technologies will provide a fundamental building block to bring Web3 to the masses:<br><br>

                •First, the Hadar blockchain natively integrates and internally uses the Move language for fast and
                secure transaction execution [2]. The Move prover, a formal verifier for smart contracts written in the
                Move language, provides additional safeguards for contract invariants and behavior. This focus on
                security allows developers to better protect their software from malicious entities.<br><br>

                •Second, to achieve high throughput and low latency, the Hadar blockchain leverages a pipelined and
                modular approach for the key stages of transaction processing. Specifically, transaction dissemination,
                block metadata ordering, parallel transaction execution, batch storage, and ledger certification all
                operate concurrently. This approach fully leverages all available physical resources, improves hardware
                efficiency, and enables highly parallel execution.<br><br>

                •Third, the Hadar modular architecture design supports client flexibility and optimizes for frequent and
                instant upgrades. Moreover, to rapidly deploy new technology innovations and support new web3 use cases,
                the Hadar blockchain provides embedded on-chain change management protocols.<br><br>

                <span class="yellow"> 1. Introduction</span><br>
                In the web2 version of the Internet, services such as messaging, social media, finance, gaming, shop-
                ping, and audio/video streaming, are provided by centralized companies that control direct access to
                user data (e.g., Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta). These companies develop infrastructure using
                application-specific software optimized for targeted use cases and leverage cloud infrastructures to de-
                ploy these applications to users. Cloud infrastructure provides access to virtualized and/or physical
                infrastructure services, such as rented virtual machines (VMs) and bare metal hardware operating inside
                data centers worldwide (e.g., AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud). As a result, building web2 Internet
                services that can scale to billions of users has never been easier than it is today. However, web2
                requires that users place explicit trust in centralized entities, a requirement that has become
                increasingly concerning to society.<br><br>

                To combat this concern, a new Internet age has begun: web3. In the web3 version of the Internet,
                blockchains have emerged to provide decentralized, immutable ledgers that enable users to interact with
                one another securely and reliably, all without requiring trust in controlling intermediaries or
                centralized entities. Similar to how web2 Internet services and applications rely on cloud
                infrastructure as building blocks, decentralized applications can use blockchains as a decentralized
                infrastructure layer to reach billions of users across the world.
                <br><br>
                However, despite the existence of many blockchains today, widespread adoption of web3 has not yet taken
                place [3]. While technology continues to advance the industry, existing blockchains are unreliable,
                impose high transaction fees for users, have low throughput limitations, suffer regular asset losses due
                to security issues, and cannot support real-time responsiveness. In comparison to how cloud
                infrastructure has enabled web2 services to reach billions, blockchains have not yet enabled web3
                applications to do the same.
                <br><br>
                <span class="yellow">2. The Hadar vision</span><br>
                The Hadar vision is to deliver a blockchain that can bring mainstream adoption to web3 and empower an
                ecosystem of decentralized applications to solve real-world user problems. Our mission is to advance the
                state-of-the-art in blockchain reliability, safety, and performance by providing a flexible and modular
                blockchain architecture. This architecture should support frequent upgrades, fast adoption of the latest
                technology advancements, and first-class support for new and emerging use cases.
                <br><br>
                <span class="yellow">3. Overview</span><br>
                The Hadar blockchain is comprised of a set of validators that jointly receive and process transactions
                from users using a byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT), proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Token holders
                lock up, or stake, tokens in their selected validators. Each validator’s consensus voting weight is
                proportionate to the amount staked into it. A validator can be active and participate in consensus.
                Likewise, a validator may also be inactive if it does not have enough stake to participate, rotates out
                of the validator set, elects to be offline as it synchronizes blockchain state, or is deemed not
                participating by the consensus protocol due to poor historical performance. Clients are any part of the
                system that need to submit transactions or query the state and history of the blockchain. Clients can
                choose to download and verify validator signed proofs of queried data. Full nodes are clients that
                replicate the transaction and blockchain state from the validators or from other full nodes in the
                network. They may elect to prune transaction history and blockchain state as desired to reclaim storage.
                Light clients only maintain the current set of validators and can query partial blockchain state
                securely, typically from full nodes. Wallets are a common example of a light client.
                <br><br>
                <span class="yellow">4. Logical data model</span><br>
                The ledger state of the Hadar blockchain represents the state of all the accounts. The ledger state is
                versioned using an unsigned 64-bit integer corresponding to the number of transactions the system has
                executed. Anyone can submit a transaction to the Hadar blockchain to modify the ledger state. Upon
                execution of a transaction, a transaction output is generated. A transaction output contains zero or
                more operations to manipulate the ledger state (called write sets), a vector of resulting events (see
                Section 5.1.1), the amount of gas consumed, and the executed transaction status.
                <br><br>

                4.1 Transactions A signed transaction contains the following information:
                •Transaction authenticator: The sender uses a transaction authenticator that includes one or more
                digital signatures to verify that a transaction is authenticated.
                •Sender address: The account address of the sender.
                •Payload: The payload either refers to an existing entry function on-chain or contains the function to
                be executed as in lined bytecode (called a script). In addition, a set of input arguments is encoded in
                byte arrays. For a peer-to-peer transaction, the inputs contain the recipient’s information and the
                amount transferred to them.
                •Gas price (in specified currency/gas units): This is the amount the sender is willing to pay per unit
                of gas to execute the transaction. Gas is a way to pay for compute, networking, and storage. A gas unit
                is an abstract measurement of computation with no inherent real-world value.
                •Maximum gas amount: The maximum gas amount is the maximum gas units the transaction is allowed to
                consume prior to aborting. The account must have at least the gas price multiplied by the maximum gas
                amount or the transaction will be discarded during validation.
                •Sequence number: The sequence number of the transaction. This must match the sequence number stored in
                the sender’s account when the transaction executes. Upon successful transaction execution, the account
                sequence number is incremented to prevent replay attacks.
                •Expiration time: A timestamp after which the transaction ceases to be valid.
                •Chain id: Identifies the blockchain that this transaction is valid for, offering further protection for
                users to prevent signing errors.
                <br><br>
                4.2 Move modules<br>
                A Move module contains Move bytecode that declares data types (structs) and procedures. It is identified
                by the address of the account where the module is declared along with a module name. For example, the
                identifier for the first currency module in Figure 2 is 0x1::coin. A module can depend on other on-chain
                modules, as shown by the wallet module in Figure 2, enabling code reuse.
                <br><br>
                A module must be uniquely named within an account, i.e., each account can declare at most one module
                with any given name. For example, the account at address 0x1 in Figure 2 could not declare another
                module named coin. On the other hand, the account at address 0x3 could declare a module named coin and
                the identifier of this module would be 0x3::coin. Note that 0x1::coin::Coin and 0x3::coin::Coin are
                distinct types and cannot be used interchangeably nor share common module code. In contrast,
                0x1::coin::Coin<0x2::wallet::USD> and 0x1::coin::Coin<0x2::wallet::JPY> are different instantiations of
                        the same generic type that cannot be used interchangeably but can share common module code.
                        Modules are grouped into packages located at the same address. An owner of this address
                        publishes the package as a whole on-chain, including the bytecode and package metadata. The
                        package meta-data determines whether a package can be upgraded or is immutable. For an
                        upgradeable package, compatibility checks are performed before the upgrade is permitted: no
                        existing entry point functions must be changed and no resources can be stored in memory.
                        However, new functions and resources can be added.
                        The Hadar framework, consisting of the core libraries and configuration for the Hadar
                        blockchain, is defined as a regular upgradeable package of modules (see Section 9.2).
                        <br><br>
                        4.3 Resources<br>
                        Similar to modules, account addresses can also have data values associated with them. Within
                        each account address, the values are keyed by their types, with at most one value of each type
                        belonging to the account. Figure 3 provides an example of this. Address 0x50 holds a single
                        value, with 0x3::coin::Coin being the fully- qualified type. 0x3 is the address where the coin
                        module is stored, coin is the name of the module and Coin is the name of the data type. Values
                        of generic types are also allowed, with different instantiations being treated as distinct
                        types. This is essential for extensibility, allowing different instantiations to share the same
                        functional code. The rules for mutating, deleting, and publishing a value are encoded in the
                        module that defines the data type. Move’s safety and verification rules prevent other code or
                        entities from directly creating, modifying, or deleting instances of data types defined in other
                        modules.
                        <br><br>
                        Having at most one top-level value of each type under an address may at first sound limiting.
                        However, this is not a problem in practice as programmers can define wrapper types with other
                        data as internal fields, thus avoiding any limitations. The Wallet struct in Figure 3 is an
                        example of how to use wrapper types.
                        It should also be noted that not all data types can be stored on-chain. For data instances to
                        qualify as top- level values, the data type must have the key ability. Similarly, the store
                        ability is required for nested values. Data types with both abilities are also called resources.
                        <br><br>
                        4.4 Ledger state<br>
                        From the perspective of the Move virtual machine (Move VM), each account consists of a set of
                        values and key-value data structures. These data structures are called table entries and are
                        stored in the Binary Canonical Serialization format (BCS). This data layout enables developers
                        to write smart contracts that can operate efficiently on small amounts of data replicated across
                        a large number of accounts, as well as on large amounts of data stored in a small number of
                        accounts. Move modules are stored similarly to account data but under an independent namespace.
                        The genesis ledger state defines the initial set of accounts and their associated state at
                        blockchain initialization.
                        At launch, the Hadar blockchain will be represented by a single ledger state. However, as
                        adoption increases and technology develops, Hadar will scale up the number of shards to increase
                        throughput (i.e., enable multiple ledger states) and support transactions that move or access
                        assets across shards. Each ledger state will maintain all on-chain assets for the specific shard
                        and provide the same account model with a fine-grained, key-value data store offering near-fixed
                        costs for storage access.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="yellow">5. A safe user experience</span><br>
                        To reach billions of Internet users, the web3 user experience must be safe and accessible. In
                        the sections below, we describe several innovations provided by the Hadar blockchain that work
                        towards this goal.
                        <br><br>
                        5.1 Transaction viability protection
                        Signing a transaction means that the signer authorizes the transaction to be committed and
                        executed by the blockchain. Occasionally, users may sign transactions unintentionally or without
                        fully considering all the ways in which their transactions might be manipulated. To reduce this
                        risk, the Hadar blockchain constrains the viability of every transaction and protects the signer
                        from unbounded validity. There are currently three different protections provided by the Hadar
                        blockchain - the sender’s sequence number, a transaction expiration time, and a designated chain
                        identifier.
                        <br><br>
                        5.2 Move-based key management<br>
                        As discussed in Section 5.2, Hadar accounts support key rotation, an important feature that can
                        help reduce the risks associated with private key compromise, long-range attacks, and future
                        advances that might break existing cryptographic algorithms. In addition, Hadar accounts are
                        also flexible enough to enable new hybrid models of custody. In one such model, a user can
                        delegate the ability to rotate the account’s private key to one or more custodians and other
                        trusted entities. A Move module can then define a policy that empowers these trusted entities to
                        rotate the key under specific circumstances. For example, the entities might be represented by a
                        k-out- of-n multi-sig key held by many trusted parties and offer key recovery services to
                        prevent user key loss (e.g., 20% of Bitcoin is currently locked up in unrecoverable accounts
                        [7]).
                        <br><br>
                        Moreover, while many wallets support various key recovery schemes, such as backing up private
                        keys to cloud infrastructure, multi-party computation, and social recovery, they are typically
                        implemented without blockchain support (i.e., off-chain). As a result, each wallet needs to
                        implement its own key management infrastructure and related operations become opaque to users.
                        In contrast, supporting key management functionality at the Hadar blockchain layer provides full
                        transparency of all key-related operations and makes it simpler to implement a wallet with rich
                        key management.
                        <br><br>
                        5.3 Pre-signing transaction transparency<br>
                        Today, wallets provide very little transparency about the transactions they sign. As a result,
                        users are often easily tricked into signing malicious transactions that may steal funds and have
                        devastating consequences. This is true even for blockchains that require enumerating all
                        on-chain data accessed by each transaction. As a result, there are few user safeguards currently
                        in place, making users vulnerable to a wide variety of attacks.
                        To address this, the Hadar ecosystem provides services for transaction pre-execution: a
                        precaution-ary measure that describes to users (in human-readable form) the outcomes of their
                        transactions prior to signing. Pairing this with a known history of prior attacks and malicious
                        smart contracts will help to reduce fraud. In addition, Hadar also enables wallets to dictate
                        constraints on transactions during execution. Violating these constraints will result in the
                        transactions being aborted, to further protect users from malicious applications or social
                        engineering attacks.

                        <span class="yellow">6. Processing</span><br>
                        6.1 Batch processing<br>
                        Batch processing is an important efficiency optimization that is part of every phase of
                        operation in the Hadar blockchain. Transactions are grouped into batches by each validator
                        during transaction dissemination, and batches are combined into blocks during consensus. The
                        execution, storage.
                        <br><br>
                        6.2 Continuous transaction dissemination<br>
                        Following the primary insight of Narwhal & Tusk [9], transaction dissemination in the Hadar
                        blockchain is decoupled from consensus. Validators continuously stream batches of transactions
                        to each other, utilizing all available network resources concurrently. Each batch distributed by
                        a validator v is persisted, and a signature on the batch digest is sent back to v. Following the
                        consensus requirements defined in Section 6.3, any 2f + 1 stake weighted signatures on the batch
                        digest form a proof of availability (PoAv). Such a proof guarantees that at least f + 1 stake
                        weighted honest validators have stored the batch, and thus all honest validators will be able to
                        retrieve it prior to execution.
                        <br><br>
                        Infinitely persisting batches of transactions can open a DoS attack vector by causing validators
                        to run out of storage and crash. To prevent this, each batch of transactions has an associated
                        timestamp. The timestamp on the batch allows efficient garbage collection at each validator. In
                        addition, a separate per-validator quota mechanism is designed to protect validators from
                        running out of space even in the most extreme circumstances, such as under potential byzantine
                        attacks. Batches also have sizing constraints that are validated prior to agreement to persist
                        to stable storage. Finally, several optimizations to de-duplicate and cache transactions reduce
                        storage costs and ensure performant integration with the parallel execution engine.
                        <br><br>
                        6.3 Block metadata ordering One common misconception is that consensus is slow and therefore the
                        primary bottleneck for blockchain throughput and latency. One of the key innovations of the
                        Hadar blockchain is to decouple non-agreement related tasks out of the consensus phase, such as
                        transaction dissemination, transaction execution/storage, and ledger certification. By
                        decoupling transaction dissemination from the consensus phase, ordering can occur with very low
                        bandwidth (block metadata and proofs only), resulting in high transaction throughput and
                        minimized latency. Today, the Hadar blockchain leverages the latest iteration of DiemBFTv4 [10],
                        an optimistically responsive BFT consensus protocol. Consensus in the common case only requires
                        two network round trips (with round trip times typically less than 300 milliseconds worldwide)
                        and dynamically adjusts to faulty validators through a leader reputation mechanism [11].
                        <br><br>
                        6.3.1 Blockchain time The Hadar blockchain adopts an approximate, agreed-upon, physical
                        timestamp for every proposed block, and correspondingly, all transactions within that block.
                        This timestamp enables many important use cases.

            <div class="descr_for_img _anim-items">Figure 6: Block-STM (component-only) benchmarks comparing the number of physical
                cores with different levels of contention.</div>
            <div class="second_text text _anim-items">6.4 Parallel transaction execution<br>
                Once consensus block metadata is ordered, transactions can be executed by any validator, full node, or
                client. At least 2f + 1 stake weighted validators have veritably persisted transactions for the proposed
                batches. Since transaction dissemination is continuous, additional honest validators will receive the
                transaction batches over time. If an honest validator has not received the transactions for the ordered
                batches by the time it reaches the execution stage, it can download them from the 2f +1 stake weighted
                validators, knowing that at least f + 1 stake weighted validators ( ≥ half of the stake weighted PoAV
                signers) are honest. An important goal for any blockchain is to enable as much parallel execution as
                possible. The Hadar blockchain advances this direction forward from both the data model and the
                execution engine.
                <br><br>
                6.4.1 Parallel data model<br>
                The Move data model natively supports global addressing of data and modules. Transactions that do not
                have overlapping conflicts in data and accounts can execute in parallel. Given the pipelined design used
                by the Hadar blockchain, reordering a group of transactions can reduce the number of conflicts, thereby
                improving concurrency. Even when transactions modify the same set of on-chain values, much of the
                transaction execution process can still be parallelized. The Hadar blockchain introduces a new concept,
                delta writes, that describes a modification to account state rather than the modified account state
                (e.g., increment an integer rather than simply determine the final value). All of the transaction
                processing can be completed in parallel, and then delta writes are applied in the correct sequence for
                conflicting values to ensure deterministic results.
                Over time, the Hadar blockchain will continue to enhance the data model in ways that improve concurrency
                (e.g., leverage read/write hints) and also improve ergonomics, making it more natural for developers to
                create, modify, and compose on-chain values. Move provides flexibility to make these improvements at
                both the language level and also through platform-specific functionality.
                <br><br>
                6.4.2 Parallel execution engine<br>
                The Block-STM parallel execution engine detects and manages the conflicts for an ordered set of
                transactions along with optimistic concurrency control to allow for maximum parallelism given a
                particular ordering [13].
                Batches of transactions are executed optimistically in parallel and validated post-execution. Un-
                successful validations lead to re-executions. Block-STM uses a multi-version data structure to avoid
                write-write conflicts. All writes to the same location are stored along with their versions, which
                contain their transaction IDs and the number of times the writing transaction was optimistically
                re-executed. When transaction tx reads a memory location, it obtains from the multi-version data
                structure the value written to this location by the highest transaction that appears before tx in the
                preset order, along with the associated version.

                <br><br>
                <span class="yellow">7. State synchronization</span><br>
                The Hadar blockchain aims to provide a high throughput, low latency system for all participants in the
                ecosystem. As a result, the blockchain must offer an efficient state synchronization protocol to
                disseminate, verify, and persist blockchain data to light clients, full nodes, and validators [14]. In
                addition, the synchronization protocol must also be tolerant of resource constraints and heterogeneity
                within the network, accounting for different users and use cases. For example, it must allow archival
                full nodes to verify and persist the entire blockchain history and state, while also enabling light
                clients to efficiently track only a small subset of the Hadar blockchain state.
                <br><br>
                To achieve this property, the Hadar blockchain leverages the authenticated ledger history and certified
                state proofs (see Section 7.6.1) offered by the validators, full nodes, and other replicators to provide
                a flexible and configurable synchronization protocol. Specifically, participants in the network can
                select different synchronization strategies to optimize for their use cases and requirements.

                <br><br>
                <span class="yellow">8. Community ownership</span><br>
                The Hadar blockchain will be owned, operated, and governed by a broad and diverse community. A native
                Hadar token will be used for transaction and network fees, governance voting on protocol upgrades and
                on- chain/off-chain processes, and securing the blockchain via a proof-of-stake model. A complete
                description of Hadar token economics will follow in a future publication.

                <br><br>
                8.1 Transaction and network fees<br>
                All Hadar transactions have a gas unit price (specified in Hadar tokens) that allows validators to
                prioritize the highest value transactions in the network. Moreover, at every stage of the pipelined
                model, there are multiple opportunities to discard low-value transactions (allowing the blockchain to
                operate efficiently when at system capacity). Over time, network fees will be deployed to ensure that
                the costs of using the Hadar blockchain are proportionate to the real-world costs of hardware
                deployment, maintenance, and node operation.
                <br><br>
                8.2 Network governance<br>
                Every significant feature change and improvement on the Hadar blockchain will go through several phases,
                including proposal, implementation, testing, and deployment. This structure creates opportunities for
                relevant parties and stakeholders to provide feedback, share concerns, and offer suggestions. The final
                phase, deployment, is typically achieved in two steps. First, a software release with the new
                functionality will be deployed to each node, and second, the functionality will be enabled, e.g., via a
                feature flag or on-chain configuration variable. Each software deployment by the node operators must be
                backward compatible, to ensure the new software is interoperable with the supported releases. The
                process of deploying a new software version may span multiple days, to account for operators in
                different time zones and any external issues. Once a sufficient number of nodes have been upgraded, the
                enablement of the new functionality can be triggered by a synchronization point, such as an agreed-on
                block height or epoch change. In emergency conditions (e.g., when downtime is unavoidable), the
                enablement can be through a manual and forced change by the node operators, and in the worst cases, a
                hard fork in the network.
                <br><br>
                8.3 Proof-of-stake consensus<br>
                To participate in transaction validation on the Hadar blockchain, validators must have a minimum
                required amount of staked Hadar tokens. The staked amounts proportionately affect the 2f + 1 stake
                weighted PoAv during transaction dissemination as well as vote weights and leader selection during block
                metadata ordering. Validators decide on the split of rewards between themselves and their respective
                stakers. Stakers can select any number of validators in which to stake their tokens for a pre-agreed
                reward split. At the end of every epoch, validators and their respective stakers will receive their
                rewards via the relevant on-chain Move modules. Any validator operator with sufficient stake can freely
                join the Hadar blockchain.

                <br><br>
                <span class="yellow">9. Performance</span><br>
                As mentioned in Section 6, the Hadar blockchain is able to achieve optimal throughput and hardware
                efficiency via its parallel, batch optimized, and modular transaction processing pipeline. Additional
                performance initiatives, such as consensus upgrades, delta writes, transaction hints, and critical path
                caching, will continue to increase throughput and improve efficiency over time.
                Today, blockchain throughput is typically measured in transactions per second. However, given the wide
                range of costs and complexity across transactions and infrastructures, this is an imprecise method to
                compare systems. Transaction latency is also equally flawed as the starting and ending points of
                submission to finality are varied across experiments.
                <br><br>
                In addition, some systems require apriori knowledge of transaction inputs and outputs and force logical
                transactions to be split into smaller, less complex transactions. Splitting a transaction results in
                poor user experiences and artificially impacts latency and throughput, without considering what the
                developer is trying to accomplish. In contrast, the Hadar approach is to enable developers the freedom
                to build without limits and to measure throughput and latency with respect to real-world use cases
                rather than synthetic transactions. The Hadar blockchain will continue to optimize individual validator
                performance, as well as exper-iment with scaling techniques that add more validators to the network.
                <br><br>
                9.1 Homogeneous state sharding<br>
                Initially, the Hadar blockchain will be launched with a single ledger state. Over time, the Hadar
                network will take a unique approach to horizontal scalability while still maintaining decentralization.
                This will occur through multiple sharded ledger states, each offering a homogeneous API and sharding as
                a first-class concept. The Hadar token will be used for transaction fees, staking, and governance on all
                shards. Data may be transferred between shards through a homogeneous bridge. Users and developers can
                choose their own sharding schemes depending on their needs. For example, developers can propose a new
                shard or cluster users within existing shards to achieve high intra-shard connections. More-over, shards
                may have different system characteristics.
